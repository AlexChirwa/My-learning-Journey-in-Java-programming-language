<h1 align="center"> My-Java-learning-streak </h1>

### **Introduction**
The motivation behind this project is to develop a solid understanding of at least one programming language. I have chosen Java due to its favorable use in developing mobile and web applications, which are my main areas of interest. Currently, I am using Eclipse for all my Java projects, and I am self-taught.

### **Learning Objectives**
My current learning target is to master the core concepts of Java. Once I have a firm grasp of the basics, I will explore its frameworks and tools.

### **Progress Tracking**
To track my progress, I have set specific milestones. After covering at least three topics, I complete a series of exercises based on those topics. This approach helps refresh my memory and enhance my knowledge.
